ivo-franka-full (this starts Gazebo with the world with the cylinder)
2.- roslaunch ivo_franka rvizpat.launch (this starts rviz, it is configured to show the images captured from the realsense camera)
3.- rosrun ivo_franka tf_d (this one is cpp file which streams the hemisphere to RViz)
This file imports a class from a hpp file I created, the hpp file contains a class for the View Space and another for the View Poses. It would be good to check it deeply if Ivo decides to keep the hemisphere configuration just like I did (that class will allow him to change the radius, to translate it, and another modification).
4. rosrun ivo_franka franka_pick2 (this one is to move the camera frame through each one of the view poses)
5. rosrun ivo_franka pointCloud.py (this one is to be able to get and observe the point cloud from the depth and RGB image)
